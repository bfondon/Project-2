# Project 2: 10,000 Hours

## Problem:
Learning a new skill is a challenge, and it's easy to lose momentum before you've reached mastery level. 

## Solution:
10,000 Hours. A minimalist habit tracker that motivates you to continue until you reach your goal of 10,000 practice hours. You can connect and compete with friends, track multiple hobbies (ie: learning Spanish, learning guitar, etc) and receive motivational mile-markers as you progress towards your goal.

  - You can also track friends progress and get messages for when friends reach milestones (100 hours, 1,000 hours, etc).
